                Hi! Check the new shot — Online Library app! This is a library where the user can read books, listen to audiobooks and podcasts 📚
            </p>

            <p className='mt-4'>
                The first screen is the main page of the app. The largest block in the app — the book area, where the user can pick a book. There are also book recommendation system in case users won’t know what to read 📕
            </p>

            <p className='mt-4'>
                On the right — the short description of the selected book, also there is a side menu with user’s account and navigation ↘️
            </p>

            <p className='mt-4'>
                The main colors — white and deep blue, we picked these neutral ones to not distract users from the content ⚪️🔵
            </p>

            <p className='mt-4'>
                The accent color is blue. Blue is usually associated with peace, clarity, and spirituality, and higher self, which matches well with the app concept 👀
            </p>

            <p className='mt-4'>
                There is a recommendation system — users can always find something interesting. Navigation by content types (books/audiobooks/podcasts) is in the header, the rest of the functionality is hidden in the side menu 📓
            </p>
